# Biometric IoT Project

This repository contains the code for a Biometric IoT Project. The project is divided into two main folders:

## 1. Backend Folder

The `backend` folder contains the server-side code for the project. It is built using Node.js and TypeScript to provide a robust and scalable API for the Biometric IoT application. To set up the backend, follow the steps below:

### Installation

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the `backend` folder.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Server

To run the backend server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start, and the API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 2. Web Folder

The `web` folder contains the client-side code for the Biometric IoT application. It is developed using React.js and Vite as a bundle builder for faster development and better performance. To set up the web application, follow the steps below:

### Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the `web` folder.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Web Application

To run the web application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To build the web application for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist` directory.
